## this is a thing i made to get better at time management. soon ill be adding project management for selecting what youre working on from a dropdown so you can track your time and see how your speed improves over time. I'd like to add some ai features like a way for the chrome extension to know whether the tabs youre on are actuaully relevant to your task, and nudge you back on track... i think it will help me with my adhd. maybe itll help some other people too. i see it as a game more than a tool, and I'll be adding more features for rich interaction and multisensory gizmos like sound effects and haptic feedback on mobile perhaps... ig we'll see.

So uh... this is just a brain dump. I'm hoping you can strain this into something concise and eloquent with nice formatting. I'd like to add a link to the github and my website as well (github.com/trentbrew/timer) and (trentbrew.com)
