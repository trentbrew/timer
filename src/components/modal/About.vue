    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">About This Project</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This project is designed to enhance time management skills. Future updates
      will include project management features, allowing you to select tasks
      from a dropdown and track your time, helping you monitor and improve your
      speed over time.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Planned AI features will help keep you focused by monitoring your browser
      tabs and nudging you back on track if you get distracted. This is
      particularly aimed at helping with ADHD, but it could benefit others as
      well.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      I envision this as more of a game than a tool, with upcoming features for
      rich interaction, including sound effects and haptic feedback on mobile
      devices.
